This talk uses `patat`, https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat which is a markdown
based presentation tool that supports images on some terminals (like MacOS'
iTerm2) and supports running code during the presentation to generate output,
which is used here to display the listings of stacker.yaml examples that are
kept separate to allow building them with the included makefile.
