# stacker [![Build Status](https://github.com/anuvu/stacker/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/anuvu/stacker/actions)

Stacker is a tool for building OCI images via a declarative yaml format.

### Installation

Stacker has various [build](doc/install.md) and [runtime](doc/running.md)
dependencies.

### Usage

See the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) for a short introduction to how to use stacker.

See the [`stacker.yaml` specification](doc/stacker_yaml.md) for full details on
the `stacker.yaml` specification.

Additionally, there are some [tips and tricks](doc/tricks.md) for common usage.

### TODO / Roadmap

* Upstream something to containers/image that allows for automatic detection
  of compression
* Design/implement OCIv2 drafts + final spec when it comes out

mostly disjoint; I need to be more creative with naming.)
